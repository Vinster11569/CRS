<hr />
<p>The prognosis is an estimate of the likely outcome from the current state of the condition. For this purpose the prognosis needs only identify if the condition is improving, static or worsening.<p>

<h2>Improving</h2>
<p>A condition that is already showing signs of improvement and recovery. Physiotherapy would be aimed at facilitating the ongoing improvement and recovery, possibly speeding up the recovery and ensuring no complications to the recovery.</p>

<h2>Static</h2>
<p>A static condition is not showing signs of natural recovery or improvement nor showing signs of worsening. The condition has remained the same for a period of time.</p>

<h2>Worsening</h2>
<p>A worsening condition is showing signs of deterioration.  This may be due to repeated or repetitive injury, infection or an indication of a more serious pathology. The condition is not recovering as expected following the normal healing process.</p>
