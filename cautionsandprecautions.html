<hr />
<h2>Cautions</h2>
<p>Cautions are findings from your subjective interview that would prevent the inclusion of specific objective physical assessment tests. They also identify any findings from the subjective interview that may be a cause you concern.</p>
<ul> 
<li>Aggravating movements with moderate- high severity or moderate-high irritability</li>
<li>High inflammatory component to the problem.</li>
<li>Red Flags</li>
<li>Yellow flags</li>
<li>Related to specific suspected pathological processes</li>
<li>Strong pain medication</li>
<li>Osteoporosis</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Epilepsy</li>
<li>Previous or known cancer</li>
<li>Cardiovascular health</li>
<li>Previous fractures close to the site of current symptoms</li>
<li>Surgical procedures in last year</li>
<li>Hypermobility / instability</li>
<li>Pregnancy</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if a shoulder flexion is described as instantly painful, causing a pain rated 9/10 VAS, that would then take several days to relieve. Then this movement may be identified as a caution and not included in the physical assessment.</p>
<p>For example, if a person is identified as having vascular pathology which is not well controlled, then any form of cervical mobilisation or manipulation would be a caution and not included in the physical assessment.</p>
<h2>Precautions</h2>
<p>Precautions are findings that may mean you change how you perform certain objective physical tests or affect the order that the tests are conducted. They also identify any finding from the subjective interview that may be a cause for concern.  Precautions are like cautions but less severe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggravating movements with low-moderate severity or low-moderate irritability</li>
<li>Low inflammatory component to the problem</li>
<li>Red Flags that are not interconnected</li>
<li>Yellow flags that are mild or unconnected</li>
<li>Related to specific suspected pathological processes</li>
<li>Low grade pain medication</li>
<li>Mild or osteoporotic changes</li>
<li>Very well controlled Diabetes
<li>Very well controlled Epilepsy</li>
<li>Cancer that has been in remission or cleared</li>
<li>Well controlled cardiovascular problems</li>
<li>Previous fractures away from the current symptoms</li>
<li>Surgical procedures over a year ago.</li>
<li>Hypermobility / instability</li>
</ul>
