<h1 align="center">Writing A Clinical Impression.</h1>
<hr />
<p>The clinical impression summarises what is likely to be causing the symptoms. It is an impression based on signs and symptoms gathered from the subjective and objective assessment rather than a diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Example clinical impression:</h2>
<p>'Acute right ankle anterior talo-fibular ligament (ATFL) sprain and associated strained peroneal muscles'.</p>
<p>'Chronic right C6-C7 facet joint pain and stiffness with associated C7 nerve root sensitisation and trapezius muscle shortening'.</p>
