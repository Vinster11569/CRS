<h2>Informal Observation</h2>
<p>Informal observations should be made as people often adjust postures and movements during formal observation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking into the clinic</li>
<li>Facial expressions</li>
<li>Ease of movement during Activities of daily living</li>
</ul>

<h2>Formal Observation</h2>
<p>Formal observation should be made at the beginning of any objective physical assessment.</p>
<p>The person may be observed in a variety of different positions. It is important to standardise the position to minimise variations on re-assessment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standing - Feet hip distance apart, or if able - march on the spot then stop.</li>
<li>Sitting - Feet supported, back supported.</li>
<li>Prone - If able â€“ bridge, lower to bed, equal gentle distraction at both ankles.</li>
<li>Supine - Equal gentle distraction at both ankles.</li>
<li>Side Lying - consider positioning of legs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The clinician should observe all views of the patient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anterior</li>
<li>Poster</li>
<li>Lateral</li>
</ul>

<p>Comparisons should be made between left and right sides and 'known ideal' alignment. Abnormal symmetry may be corrected to assess for any change in the symptoms.</p>
<p>The following may be observed...</p>
<ul>
<li>Postural assessment</li>
<li>Muscle form</li>
<li>Soft tissue</li>
<li>Gait</li>
<li>Alignment</li>
<li>Skin creases</li>
<li>Erythma</li>
