<hr />
<p>Genics are used to describe the source of the symptoms:</p>
<p>Arthrogenic Pain</p>
<p>Arthrogenic pain relates to the joint and related structures such as the joint capsule, menisci, labarum and ligaments.</p>

<p>Neurogenic Pain</p>
<p>Neurogenic pain relates to the nerve which includes the spinal cord, nerve root and peripheral nerve and autonomic nerve.</p>
<p>Common pain description for nerve root pain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pins and needles</li>
<li>Commonly described as a sharp or shooting pain</li>
<li>No diurnal pattern</li>
<li>Maybe associated with sensory changes such as pins and needles and /or numbness in a dermatomal pattern</li>
<li>May be associated with muscle weakness in a myotomal pattern</li>
<li>Nerve root may be tender on palpation of surrounding structures</li>
<li>Often no clear aggravating and easing factors but may be present if associated with disc or space occupying lesion</li>
</ul>

<p>Common pain description for peripheral nerve pain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pins and needles</li>
<li>Difficulty in explaining the kind of pain often describing bizarre sensations such as: tooth ache, burning, electric shocks, like lightening, ants crawling, running water etc.</li>
<li>No diurnal pattern</li>
<li>Maybe associated with sensory changes such as pins and needles and /or numbness in a peripheral nerve skin supply pattern</li>
<li>May be associated with muscle weakness in a peripheral nerve muscle supply pattern</li>
<li>Peripheral nerve may be tender on palpation</li>
<li>Often no clear aggravating and easing factors but may be present if associated with disc or space occupying lesion</li>
</ul>
<p>Common pain description for autonomic nerve pain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stinging, aching, pressure like description of pain</li>
<li>Difficulty in explaining the kind of pain often describing bizarre sensations such as: tooth ache, burning, electric shocks, like lightening, ants crawling, running water etc.</li>
<li>No diurnal pattern</li>
</li>Maybe associated with sensory changes such as pins and needles and /or numbness in unusual pattern.  I.e. Not a dermatomal or peripheral nerve pattern</li>
<li>Swelling is often present</li>
<li>Erythema or redness of the skin</li>
<li>Skin often appears shiny</li>
</li>Unusual areas of hair growth</li>
</ul>

<p>Discogenic Pain</p>
<p>Discogenic pain relates to the spinal discs.</p>
<p>Common pain description for discogenic pain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain on flexion is sharp and shooting</li>
<li>Pain on flexion and rotation  is sharp and shooting</li>
<li>Commonly associated with nerve root neurogenic symptoms</li>
<li>Excruciating pain when server</li>
<li>Constant and unremitting when sever with loss of extension range</li>
</ul>

<p>Vasculogenic Pain</p>
<p>Vasculogenic pain relates to any part of the vascular system.</p>
<p>Common pain description for vascular pain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throbbing</li>
<li>Diffuse</li>
<li>Intermittent with movement</li>
<li>Deep</li>
<li>Aching</li>
</ul>
<p>Viscerogenic Pain</p>
<p>Viscerogenic pain relates to any viscera. Eg. Kidney, Liver, Gut, Heart.</p>

<li>Burning pain</li>
<li>Stabbing pain</li>
<li>Heart - central chest pain, left arm pain</li>
<li>Pancreas - left waistline - anterior and posterior</li>
<li>Gall bladder - right waistline - anterior</li>
<li>Appendix - right lower quadrant - anterior</li>
<li>Kidney - lower quadrant left to hip and right</li>
<li>Colon - Left groin</li>
</ul>

<p>Inflammatory Pain</p>
<p>Inflammatory pain relates to pain stimulated by chemicals of inflammation.</p>
<p>Common pain description for inflammatory pain is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear diurnal pattern = early morning stiffness, eases with movement (5-30mins), mornings feels better, worse as day progresses</li>
<li>Unclear aggravating and easing factors</li>
<li>Dull ache</li>
<li>Throbbing</li>
<li>Constant but variable</li>
<li>Often high irritability</li>
</ul>

<p>Mechanical Pain</p>
<p>Mechanical pain is nociceptor activation in musculoskeletal tissue due to pressure build up and release with changes of position.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear aggravating and easing factors</li>
<li>Stimulated by strong mechanical stimulus</li>
<li>sharp</li>
<li>Often an on / off pain with low irritability</li>
</ul>
<p>Pain from a Serious Pathology</p>
<p>Red flags may be indicators of serious pathology (please see link on red flags for more information)</p>
<p>Descriptors of red flag symptoms are typically:</p>
<p>Unremitting pain that does not change with a change in position / posture</p>
<p>Unremitting pain that worsens at night</p>
<p>Pain that causes someone to wake in the night.</p>

<p>Pain associated with a dysfunctional pain system</p>
<p>Pain that extends beyond the expected period of healing may be due to a dysfunctional pain system. This may be for several reasons </p>
<ol>
<li>Psychological or social factors leading to maintaining of the painful symptoms.   Pain maintained by psychosocial factors can be identified using the “Yellow flag” system. (please see link on yellow flags for more information).</li>
<li>Central pain sensitisation - Allodynia</li>
<li>Complex regional pain syndrome</li>
</ol>
<p>Care must be taken to differentiate from those who have recurrent episodes of pain.</p>
<p>People presenting with a dysfunctional pain system typically...</p>
<ul>
<li>The severity of the patient's pain may not mirror their observed functional ability</li>
<li>The patient may describe emotional factors</li>
<li>Allodynia - Triggering a pain response from a stimuli which do not normally provoke pain</li>
<li>Hyperalgesia - increased sensitivity to pain. An extreme or exaggerated reaction to a stimulus which is normally painful</li>
<li>Variable or inconsistent descriptions of pain</li>
<li>Belief that pain is harmful or disabling</li>
<li>Belief that pain must be gone before attempting any activities</li>
<li>Belief that pain is uncontrollable</li>
<li>VAS score may be above 10</li>
</ul>
