<p>Acute: typically less than 6 weeks duration this mirrors the inflammatory phase of the condition. Pain will typically limit activities and other symptoms such as muscle spasm, pain inhibition of muscles and swelling maybe present.<p>
<p>Sub-acute: typically 6-12 weeks duration, this mirrors the remodelling phase of the condition. Pain will be less dominant and will typically only occur when the healing tissue is over loaded. Swelling will have resolved and deconditioning maybe present.</p>
<p>Chronic: symptoms for more than 3 months duration, this is past the normal healing time for tissues. There may be other factors that are maintaining the pain such as central sensitisation, on-going pathology or psychosocial factors.</p>
<p>Acute on chronic: on-going pathology can cause chronic pain but the patient may get acute flare ups of pain and swelling during this time.</p>
