<p>The acronym ICE stands for</p>

<p><strong><u>I</u></strong> = <em>Ideas</em><br />
<strong><u>C</u></strong> = <em>Concerns</em><br />

<p>The ICE acronym is used to aid the exploration of individuals' thoughts of their own condition.  These questions explore the individuals' knowledge of the condition, previous diagnosis, any worries the patient has which can then link to any yellow flags and often clarify the focus for constructing individual centred goals.</p>

<h2>Ideas</h2>

<p>"Do you have any ideas of what may be causing your symptoms? This may be based on how it feels, for example, does it feel like a muscle, ligament or joint problem? Or it may be based on things other professionals have diagnosed? Or from your own research, for example on the internet?"</p>

<h2>Concerns</h2>

<p>"Do you have any concerns about the problem? This may be based on how it feels, or what other health professionals have said to you? Or from your own research, for example on the internet?"</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>"Do you have any expectation of physiotherapy? Are there any particular treatments that you have received before that you think may be beneficial? Or any treatments you have read about that you think may be helpful? What do you want to get out of physiotherapy?"</p>
