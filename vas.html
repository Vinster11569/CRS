<h1 align="center">Visual and Verbal Analogue Scales (VAS)</h1>
<hr />
<p>These scales are used to gain a descriptive measure of your patient’s pain. This measure will be individual to your patient’s pain threshold but can give you a subjective measure of their pain in order to assess its severity and how it changes with certain movements / activities and also to measure effects of treatment on the pain.  The patient is asked to rate their pain in relation to the worst pain they have ever experienced, there are some examples of different versions of this below: Generally a rating over 7/10 is considered severe.</p> 

<h2>Verbal Descriptor Scale</h2>
          
<p>None&nbsp;-&nbsp;Mild&nbsp;-&nbsp;Moderate&nbsp;-&nbsp;Severe</p>

<h2>Visual Analogue Scale</h2>

<p>The person marks along a 10cm line where they would rate their pain. A measurement is then taken from the beginning of the line to provide a pain score.</p>

<p>no pain&nbsp;&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;worst pain</p>

<h2>Numerical Rating Scale</h2>
  
<p><em>"On a scale of zero to ten (0-10), with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, What number would you give your pain?"</em></p>
